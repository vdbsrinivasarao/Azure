PowerShell-Execution-Policy

Set ExecutionPolicy on the Server PowerShell is secure by default. The first thing keep in mind that PowerShell won't execute scripts until you allowd to execute it means explicitly you have to give it permission to do so. PowerShell has four execution policies that govern how it should execute scripts

Restricted
No scripts allowed
You can set PowerShell’s execution policy by using the following cmdlet: PowerShell won't run any scripts. This is PowerShell's default execution policy

Setting
Unrestricted
No requirements; all scripts allowed
PowerShell ignores digital signatures but will still prompt you before running a script downloaded from the Internet.

RemoteSigned
All local scripts allowed; only signed remote scripts.
PowerShell won't run scripts downloaded from the Internet unless they have a digital signature, but scripts not downloaded from the Internet will run without prompting. If a script has a digital signature, PowerShell will prompt you before it runs a script from a publisher it hasn't seen before.

AllSigned
All scripts need to be signed
PowerShell will only run scripts that are signed with a digital signature. If you run a script signed by a publisher PowerShell hasn't seen before, PowerShell will ask whether you trust the script's publisher.
